# 📊 Benchmarking Class vs Element Selectors in JavaScript (WIP)

This repository contains a simple yet effective benchmarking tool to compare the performance of class selectors versus element selectors in JavaScript. The benchmark involves creating a specified number of HTML elements (default: 10,000) and measuring the time it takes to apply styles using both types of selectors.

## 🌟 Features

- **Performance Comparison:** Compare the time taken to apply styles using class selectors and element selectors.
- **Dynamic Element Generation:** Generates a specified number of HTML elements dynamically for the benchmark (default: 10,000, max: 100,000).
- **Input for Element Count:** Enter a custom number of elements to benchmark, providing flexibility in testing.
- **Clear and Run Benchmark:** Easy-to-use buttons to clear and rerun the benchmark.
- **Results Display:** Displays the results in a clear and concise table format on the webpage.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter the number of elements you want to create for the benchmark (default is 10,000).
4. Click on "Run Benchmark" to perform the test.
5. View the results displayed in the table on the webpage.
6. Use the "Clear Benchmark" button to reset the elements and results.
